# ETH Piggy Bank on zkSync Era

A simple Solidity smart contract that lets users deposit and withdraw ETH.  
Deployed to zkSync Era Sepolia Testnet for low-cost transactions.

## âœ¨ Features

- Users can deposit any amount of ETH into their personal balance.
- Users can withdraw ETH whenever they like.
- Tracks balances securely.
- Emits events on deposit and withdrawal.
- Uses `call` for safe withdrawals compatible with zkSync.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- Solidity ^0.8.20
- zkSync Remix Plugin
- MetaMask

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Connect your wallet to zkSync Era Sepolia.
2. Deploy the contract via Remix with the zkSync plugin.
3. Use the contract's functions:
   - `deposit()` â€” send ETH into the contract.
   - `withdraw(amount)` â€” withdraw ETH.
   - `getBalance(address)` â€” check balance.
